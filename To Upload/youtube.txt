Title: “Preventing Crowd Crush: Simulating Movements within a Multi-Exhibit Museum Hallway” The goal is to model and simulate how people might move in a crowd with different interests in Exhibits, and to have a meter for how many people are present in the hallway at a time to make sure the number doesn’t go above some specified safe threshold (preventing crowd crush).  This simulation incorporates elements of random walks and object-oriented programming to simulate each person, as well as a vectorial representaion of their interests within artistic genres that can align differently with each exhibit in the hallway, and thus how they might move in a certain direction until they ultimately leave the museum. People (modeled as a yellow block) will enter through the right of the screen, and move (if permissible) according to the rules specified above.
